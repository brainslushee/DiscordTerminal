UML Diagram? For posterity?

File Structure
     -Socket.py (contains login info and socket)
     -Message.py (Class for messages)
     -Functions.py (Misc functions)
     -Servers.py? (Maybe a class for the servers, depends on api)
     		  -Channels.py? (Subclass for servers)


Features to add later:
	 -Voice
	 -Image render
