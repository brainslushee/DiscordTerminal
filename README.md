# DiscordTerminal
Run Discord in a terminal. Look like you're doing something important.
An install file is included for dependencies. Python 3 is also required.

This project utilizes the discord.py package.

There have been issues downloading the inquirer library on Windows machines, so currently this will only work on Linux.

Made in loving memory of Chiodos.
