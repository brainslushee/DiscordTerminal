# DiscordTerminal
Run Discord in a terminal. Look like you're doing something important.
An install file is included for dependencies. Python 3 is also required.

This project utilizes the discord.py package.

There have been issues downloading the inquirer library on Windows machines, so currently this will only work on Linux.
