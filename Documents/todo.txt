1) If config != "enter name here", auto login
2) Switch servers/private convo (hotkeys? scroll menu?) and channels
3) View private messages
4) Send private messages
6) Make docstrings for each function
7) Make Shift S to SHIFT server, Shift C to SHIFT channel. Probably not shift, incase someone wants to type capital letters. Some other hot key.
8) Re-organize functions and rename files
9) Have past 20ish messages display on screen right away when channel changed
10) Figure out solution if a server has LARGE amount of channels
11) Maybe reimplement project in curses?
